            Breaker is a app which helps you keep breaks from work or playing games.
            <br>
            Just download it, run it, choose time and what kind of breaks do you want to have.
            <br>
            When the time runs out, the app will make a messagebox and keep a sound.
            <br>
            The app is pmade with python and its one of my very first projects.
            <br>
            It's littlebit copied from break pro.
