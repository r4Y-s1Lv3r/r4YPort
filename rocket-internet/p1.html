            Robot AIR

        <p>
            AIR is a robot which can move by itself in a room.
            <br>
            It uses ultrasonic sensor HC-SR04 to measure the distance. Micro servo SG90 helps the robot to "turn its head around" and see objects next to it.
            <br>
            It uses two 28BYJ-48 stepper motors to move around. The stepper motor drivers are ULN2003. The robot also has a thermistor to measure the temperature and print it to serial monitor.
            <br>
            The main circuitboard of the robot is pre-made Elegoo Arduino Mega 2560. The robot also contains a sensor which tells the robot that is it correct way around and a led and a buzzer to give an alarm if its wrong side around.
            <br>
            The robot is powered by a 9 volt battery.
