            Elevator buttom system
        </h1>
        <p>
            This is a button system for elevator. It was made as a school project. It's powered by pre-made Elegoo Arduino Mega 2560. It has 2 buttons, 1 buzzer, few resistors and 1 motor.
            It's pretty lame but i wanted to share it too.
